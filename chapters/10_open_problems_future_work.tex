\chapter{Open Problems \& Future Work}
\label{ch:future_work}


Considering GRAPHINIUS an arbitrarily extendable computing platform (which uses graphs as underlying, universal data structures), there are many possibilities to build upon this work, ranging from small improvements to the introduction of fundamentally new infrastructure, transcending the use of contemporary graph libraries - this section shall give a brief - and certainly incomplete - outline of this potential:


\section{Graph generators (graph types)}
\label{sect:graph_gen}


\section{Graph classifiers}
\label{sect:graph_class}


\section{JSVM based grid computing}
\label{sect:jsvm_grid}


\section{General processing / ML pipelines}
\label{sect:pipelines}


\section{Meta ML / heuristics database}
\label{sect:heuristics}


\section{Algorithmic recommender}
\label{sect:algo_recommender}
